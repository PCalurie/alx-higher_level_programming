Database Design is a collection of processes that facilitate the designing, development, implementation and maintenance of enterprise data management systems. Properly designed database are easy to maintain, improves data consistency and are cost effective in terms of disk storage space. The database designer decides how the data elements correlate and what data must be stored.
Data operations using SQL is relatively simple

Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships. The purpose of Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate redundant (repetitive) data and ensure data is stored logically.
A KEY in SQL is a value used to identify records in a table uniquely. An SQL KEY is a single column or combination of multiple columns used to uniquely identify rows or tuples in the table. SQL Key is used to identify duplicate information, and it also helps establish a relationship between multiple tables in the database.
	- A primary is a single column value used to identify a database record uniquely.
	- Foreign Key references the primary key of another Table! It helps connect your Tables
